# cpsc305-computerSimulator
CPSC 305 Computer Simulator Project by [Stefano C. Coronado](https://github.com/scoronado12) and [Melody Sepehrar](https://github.com/judebarrett)

# Current Progress of the Project
As of 2019-10-16, we have most of this portion of the project except for being able to properly fetch and print memory from the chip. We are sure this is a small issue that can easily be fixed after clarifying anything we are potentially doing wrong.

# Future Scope
The Memory Simulator will be moved into an archive of some sort while another copy of it will be used in the overall final product of the Computer Simulator.
